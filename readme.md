## Ideation
I'm beginning to build a website for Forest Street Carpentry, a small, local
carpentry company in Portland, Maine, run by two people out of a garage. Matt and
Nolan build custom furniture with reclaimed wood as well as custom remodeling in homes.
Their website will feature a home landing page with a photo or two that represent
what they're all about and their logo. Perhaps a single sentence explaining the
essence of their business. The about page will have a bio of both Matt and Nolan
with a photo and some information about how they got into the business together and
their philosophy. The contact page will have their personal contact information as
well as links to their social media accounts, a google map of their location and a
form to submit inquiries. The gallery page will have a portfolio of some of their
work and maybe some photos of them working. The photos will be split into categories
of what kind of work--furniture, kitchens, etc. but that will most likely be if I have time.

## Wireframe and Design
I managed to use an online mockup tool to create some wireframes of what the
general look of the site will be. The site will be a minimalist design with very simple
colors, fonts and layouts. Because of the nature of the business, I will utilize black and white,
earth tones and wood grain images for textures. Each page will have the same heading/menu bar (sticky)
and the site open on a sort of entry page.

## Finished Product
This final project-- and this class-- were truly a pleasure! I really enjoyed being
able to exercise all of my creativity for this project and be able to see the progress
I've made come together in one site. It's heartening to know that I can build a functional,
interactive and aethetically pleasing site with the knowledge I'm walking away from this
course with. It was definitely a struggle at times. I spent probably 30 hours total
on the design, coding and styling for my site. There were times when I spent probably
far too much time focusing on one tiny detail, but those were the most satisying to see come to
fruition. It feels good to finally be done with the project, but I hope to continue to use my
web dev skills later on!
