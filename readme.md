## Ideation
I'm beginning to build a website for Forest Street Carpentry, a small, local
carpentry company in Portland, Maine, run by two people out of a garage. Matt and
Nolan build custom furniture with reclaimed wood as well as custom remodeling in homes.
Their website will feature a home landing page with a photo or two that represent
what they're all about and their logo. Perhaps a single sentence explaining the
essence of their business. The about page will have a bio of both Matt and Nolan
with a photo and some information about how they got into the business together and
their philosophy. The contact page will have their personal contact information as
well as links to their social media accounts, a google map of their location and a
form to submit inquiries. The gallery page will have a portfolio of some of their
work and maybe some photos of them working. The photos will be split into categories
of what kind of work--furniture, kitchens, etc. but that will most likely be if I have time.
