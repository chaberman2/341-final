            <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>

            <p>Forest Street Carpentry is the product of a friendship that was born in a classroom
              at the University of Southern Maine. Nolan and Matt bonded over their shared love
              of skiing. When Nolan was looking for a summer job, Matt set him up with a job. After
              realizing their foreman would only stifle any creativity they might have, Nolan and Matt
              decided to strike out on their own. Our philosophy is, if you're exercising your mental
              and creative capacities, having fun and working in good company, you will be successful.</p>

            <p>Nolan Sullivan is a Cape Elizabeth, Maine, native.
              His talent for carpentry began as a summer job in his teens but has grown to be one
              of his passions. Nolan is about to finish a degree in environmental
              policy and planning from the University of Southern Maine. Nolan recently found an interest in
              art and custom furniture and greatly enjoys the time he spends in the
              shop. In his free time, you can find Nolan skiing, fishing and hiking.</p>

            <p>Matthew Jones grew up in Milford, Maine. Carpentry started as just a
              job for him, but he has found a way to incorporate his artistic style into the
              pieces he designs. Matt is about to graduate from the Univeristy of Southern Maine
              with a degree in environmental studies. When he's not in the shop, Matt snowboards,
              hikes and spends time with his baby daughter, Lillian Nora.</p>
